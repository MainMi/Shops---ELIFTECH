## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in the development mode.

With the latest significant update, the project has evolved into a comprehensive MERN stack application. The back-end has been entirely restructured to improve performance and maintainability. Additionally, the integration of React-Redux has significantly enhanced state management, providing a more robust and efficient client-side logic.

Remember, this application consists of two parts: the back-end and the front-end. To ensure smooth operation, both need to be up and running concurrently. 

After you start the application, open your web browser and visit these addresses:

- [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to access the front-end of the application. Here you will interact with the user interface, including all the visuals and interactive elements.

- [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to connect to the back-end server. This server handles all data processing, business logic, and database interactions. 

If you encounter issues while running the application, please ensure that both of these ports are open and not being used by other applications.
